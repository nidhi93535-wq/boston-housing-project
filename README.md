Boston Housing Regression Project:
This is a simple machine learning project that predicts Boston house prices using regression techniques.
Description:
   > We use the HousingData.csv file, which contains various features about houses and neighborhoods in Boston (number of rooms, crime rate, tax rate, etc.)

   >The target we predict is MEDV (Median value of owner-occupied homes).

   >The project handles missing values, explores the data, applies Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models, then fine-tunes the Decision Tree for better accuracy.

   >Key data trends and model results are visualized.

How to Run:

   > Make sure HousingData.csv and main.py are in the same folder.

   > Install required dependencies:
        pip install -r requirements.txt
   >Run the main program:
        python main.py
   >We will see model results and some plots.
